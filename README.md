### Introduction

This repository contains the modified caffe library and network architectures for our paper "[Automated Melanoma Recognition in Dermoscopy Images via Very Deep Residual Networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7792699)".

### Installation
For installation, please follow the instructions of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).

###Note
- We have added a new Imageseg datalayer to read image and segmentation masks from a list file. 
- The pre-trained ResNet-50 model can be downloaded from [here](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AAFW2-FVoxeVRck&id=4006CBB8476FF777%2117887&cid=4006CBB8476FF777).
